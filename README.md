# Todo App

## Setting up the dev environment

1. Install node v19.4.0 (if you have another version and would like to install v19 without deleting the other version use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).

2. Ensure you have [yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

3. Clone the repo

4. From within the repo, run
    - `nvm use` (only if you used nvm to install node).
    - `yarn`
    - `expo start`

5. Install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code from the `expo start` command, or use one of the emulation options.

6. Helpful VSCode extentions might be `Prettier` and `ESLint`
